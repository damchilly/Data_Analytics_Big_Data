# UT Certificate in Data Analytics/Big_Data
# In UT Data Analytics/ Big Data course I learned the algorithmic and organizational skills required to scale data analysis to
#large server farms, computing clouds, and the web, including an understanding of the design and implementation differences 
#between single-computer and cloud-scale programs, analytics, and data processing. I also gained a deep knowledge of predictive
#data analysis, ranging from discovering patterns and correlations in data to making predictions and estimating their accuracy.
#In this course, I discerned what algorithms will be able to learn from the data most efficiently to answer the information
#needs, deployed the learning algorithms, interpreted the results, and effectively communicated the results of the analysis to
#non-technical stakeholders. As part of this process, I mastered fundamentals of scaling up data analysis to a large cloud
#computing platform where I became proficient in working with map-reduce-based systems and leveraging the computing power of the
#cloud to prepare very large data sets for deep analysis, as well as learn how to train and apply modern machine learning
#algorithms to large processed datasets. I also learn how to identify the types of business questions for which Big Data
# analyses can provide significant insights in support of business decision-making.
#
#The skills I developed in UT Certificate in Data Analystics/Big Data are:
#
#Frame and organize business questions in ways that can be answered through Big Data analysis and meet the information needs of
#a project
# Identify types of questions for which data analysis cannot provide accurate information.
# Acquire, process, and analyze extremely large data sets using data mining methods to discover patterns or do data exploration
# Install, run, and apply machine learning tools to different kinds of data
# Operate the Amazon AWS cloud computing platform for data analysis
# Discover and mount very large public datasets on the AWS platform
# Set up and run Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) instances for data analysis
# Formulate the machine learning process to answer domain-specific problems
# Interpret the results of data analysis and data mining to make predictions and to establish the reliability of those
# predictions
# Communicate results to management and other non-technical audiences
# Avoid pitfalls and mistakes commonly made when applying machine learning methods
# Provision and utilization of AWS EC2 instances
